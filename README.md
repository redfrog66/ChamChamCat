## What is Cham Cham Cham?
This is a two-player game that you’ve probably seen on at least one variety show before. It’s an incredibly simple game; all you have to do is face the other player and then point left or right.

If the other player turns their head in the same direction you have pointed, you win. Simple as that! Just make sure to turn your head in the opposite direction to keep winning!
